		Milk Society -<br><br>

The milk producers of the village with the support of the milk union form a village dairy cooperative society. The milk producers become members by buying a minimum of one share of the society and paying an entrance fee as per the bye-laws. All these members form the general body of the society, which has the supreme powers subject to the State Cooperative Act, Rules and Bye-laws.    The society has an elected Managing Committee (MC) including the Chairman from amongst the member producers as per the provisions of the bye-laws. All the positions of the MC are honorary. The committee employs paid staff to run the day-to-day affairs of the society. The number of such staff depends upon the size of the business of the society.

Jainism<br><br>
<p>
Jainism (/ˈdʒeɪnɪzəm/),[1] traditionally known as Jain Dharma, is an ancient Indian religion and a method of acquiring perfect knowledge of self and universe and perfect joy through extrasensory means as sensory means are incapable of acquiring them. The main religious premises of the Jain dharma are ahiṃsā (non-violence), anekāntavāda (many-sidedness), aparigraha (non-attachment). Devout Jains take five main vows: ahiṃsā (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (not stealing), and aparigraha (non-possessiveness). These principles have affected Jain culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle. Parasparopagraho Jīvānām (the function of souls is to help one another) is its motto and the Ṇamōkāra mantra is its most common and basic prayer.
